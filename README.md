# Flex Team Sharepoint Site Review

This document outlines the findings based on careful review of the Flex Team Sharepoint site.  The goal of this document is to provide details to the team about aspects of the site that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional, while also focusing on possible areas of growth/updating for the site.

Currently, this file uses html that does not completely adjust to Github's markdown language.  My suggestion is to open this document in vscode (with the Markdown All In One extension) or another editor that accepts html and styling in markdown.
