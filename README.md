# Flex Team Documents

The documents contained in this repository focus on manuals and how-to docs for teachers and educators, as well as overview/finding documents.  I'm so excited to help the AV team organize and manage their OneNote effectively!

Currently, this file uses html that does not completely adjust to Github's markdown language.  My suggestion is to open this document in vscode (with the Markdown All In One extension) or another editor that accepts html and styling in markdown.
