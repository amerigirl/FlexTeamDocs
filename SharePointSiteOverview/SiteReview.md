##### 2.1 Areas Of Strength

<br>
While the site is in need of updating, the site itself is functional and being used according to its stated purpose.  There are approximately 16 people who currently have access to the site.  Analytics show usage of the last 90 days, though it is small in comparison to desired goals. A few items to note:

1. All links on the side panel are functioning properly and either open to a new tab or open in the same window. The image above shows 8 links including the home link and all are functional. All links in the helpful sites are also working.
2. Each card on the main page is aesthetically pleasing for clients and is working as expected, opening to either training or appointment setups.
3. The video at the bottom, which focuses on teaching in Flex mode, is opening and working properly.

##### 2.2 Standout Areas of High Success

<br>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 3rem; justify-content: center; margin-Left: 2rem;">
  <div>
    <img src="./images/contactPage.png" alt="Contact Us Page" width="300" height="250" style="outline: .5px solid black">
    <p style="font-size: 9px; font-weight: bold; line-height:0;">Fig. 3: Contact Us Page</p>

    <p style="font-size: 9px; font-weight: bold; line-height:0;">Fig. 4: Student Innovations Page</p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

The Contact Us and the Student Innovation pages are extremely well developed, containing:
   
  1. Eye-catching banners and centered images,
  2. Well organized information and well-placed links, and
  3. An overall structure and color scheme that is aesthetically pleasing.

<br>

#### 3. Areas of Growth

Below is a list of items that, if implemented, would increase both the aesthetic appeal of the site as well as its ease of use for clients.  These items are in no particular order and represent a first draft of possible fixes:

1. Creating consistent capitalization and font sizes across the side panel. 
2. Creating a layout upgrade that 
   1. adds helpful sites ready and viewable for ease of use.
   2. adjusts the size of the cards to add space and structure.
   3. creates a "landing section" on the home page as a way to orient users.
   4. adjusts the placement and size of the video to make room for more content
3. Adding a banner or landing image to orient users to the Flex Page.
4. A more organized and purposeful link system for users. 

<br>

#### 4. Conclusions

The Flex Team Sharepoint site is a solid site with functional links and client interaction.   It also has standout pages that serve as a model for the home page layout.  To do this, significant changes to the layout will be needed as well as sections added for ease of use and understanding by clients.
