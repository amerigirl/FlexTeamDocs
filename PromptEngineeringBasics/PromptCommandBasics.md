# Asking an AI (Prompt Engineering)
Getting help from an AI application (like chatGPT) is nearly a standard at this point. Using AI to help you teach and learn is a great way to integrate technology into your teaching practices and help you create lesson plans and targeted response questions quickly!

### Cool Things an AI can do for you as an educator!

An AI can save you time and energy by completing tasks in seconds, like
  * creating writing prompts
  * creating simple tests based on readings or concepts
  * giving you ideas on ways to creatively present material



Let's start with this short video by Jeff Su.  After that, we can talk about a few considerations when working with AI, and finally some AI resources to help get you started.

Jeff breaks down creating the perfect question to 6 basic components: 

1. Task
2. Context
3. Exemplar
4. Persona
5. Format
6. Tone

#### A few considerations about AI prompting

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you ask questions to any AI:

1. This is a machine and not a person; it needs a specific prompt; the more specific the better! 
2. Since AI uses learning models based on the internet, sometimes it gets things wrong.  If you are looking to share facts based on an AI prompt, be open to checking for accuracy. 
3. Ask questions!  It's ok to ask clarifying questions, or cut and paste response sections BACK into the AI and say "can you explain this in detail?"
